### Technologies used in this project

#### Element.closest()
##### The closest() method traverses the Element and its parents (heading toward the document root) until it finds a node that matches the provided selector string. Will return itself or the matching ancestor. If no such element exists, it returns null.

#### Turning HTML Collection into an Array with spread operator
##### [ ...slides.children ]

#### Array.prototype.indexOf()
##### The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

#### delete operator
##### The JavaScript delete operator removes a property from an object; if no more references to the same property are held, it is eventually released automatically.
